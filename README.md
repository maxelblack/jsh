# JavaShell

***A better choice than installing Shell tools.**

**Unfortunately, this project has stopped updating. [A new project](https://github.com/maxelblack/psh) has been set up to replace it.**

JavaShell can provide more advanced functions than ordinary shells.

For example, a highly customized plug-in system, complete operating instructions, and perfect integration of a single executable JAR package program (just enter the JAR name like exe and press Enter to run directly).
